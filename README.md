<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brian Hudson</h1>
<h4 align="left">I'm an HR professional with 10 years of experience dealing with a myriad of tasks, but my love has always been data. Six years ago, I began my journey with data manipulation by self-learning Excel; creating different workbooks for automation tasks via formulas, VBA and power queries, creating pivot tables/charts for presentations all while constantly improving my knowledge and efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently, I finished my training certificates on Sololearn and DataCamp for SQL and R and I just this month finished my Google Data Analytics certificate. Currently Iâ€™m honing my skills and I hope to use this newly obtained knowledge for my passion for solving problems and transition into a data analyst role. I hope that you will follow my journey as I increase my skillset through my personal projects and technical skills training and most importantly, improve my problem solving and critical thinking skills as I believe itâ€™s the mindset, not the technical skills, that are the most important trait of a successful data scientist.</h4>

<h4 align="left">- ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:  * Advanced SQL code, R ggplot2 visualization techniques, and webscraping with R and Google Sheets *</h4>
<h4 align="left">- ðŸ”­ Roadmap: * Once I'm proficient in SQL and R, I will move towards Python with Numpy, Pandas, etc to diversify *</h4>
