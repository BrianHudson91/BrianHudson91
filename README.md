<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brian Hudson</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm an HR professional with 10 years of experience dealing with a myriad of tasks, but my love has always been data. Five years ago, I began my journey with data manipulation with learning Excel on my own; creating different workbooks for automation tasks via formulas, VBA and power queries, creating pivot tables/charts for presentations all while constantly improving my knowledge and efforts. Recently, earlier this year I had finished my training on Sololearn and DataCamp for SQL and R and I just this month finished my Google Data Analytics certificate. Currently Iâ€™m honing my skills and I hope to use this newly obtained knowledge for my passion for solving problems and transition into a data analyst role. I hope that you will follow my journey as I increase my skillset through my personal projects and technical skills training and most importantly, improve my problem solving and critical thinking skills as I believe itâ€™s the mindset, not the technical skills, that are the most important trait of a successful data scientist.</h3>

- âš¡ Fun fact **I'm OCD about organization - I have a task list for my daily personal life**
